			<h3>Yes Chef helps me find more free time</h3>
			<p>
				My wife and I highly value our free time. So do most other people
				these days. I come from a culinary background and cooking
				has always been important in my life.<br> My wife and I try and
				meal plan most weeks to help give us more free time.<br> 
				We both have an active lifestyle that
				includes biking, travel, our dogs, our friends, and our own personal
				journeys.<br> Yes Chef came from the necessity of me wanting to improve 
				the process of meal planning in our house.<br> My goal is to eventually have
				Yes Chef be a one stop solution for us.<br> 
			<p>
			<h4>What does Yes Chef Do?</h4>
			<p>
				Yes Chef allows you to make your own favorite meal database.<br>
				You can browse and sort your meals.<br> If you don't
				feel like browsing, find a recipe at Random.<br> Once you've
				found something you like. Add it to the Meal Plan.<br> 
				Eventually you will be able to not only add your recipes to a grocery cart automatically, but also
			    send those groceries to your favorite grocery store app and either pick up your list or just have it delivered.
