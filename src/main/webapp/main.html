		<h3>Yes Chef helps me find more free time</h3>
		<p>
			My wife and I highly value our free time. As do most other people I
			know these days.<br> I come from a culinary background and
			cooking has always been important in my life.<br> My wife and I
			try and meal plan most weeks.<br> This saves us tons of time for
			us to focus on ourselves and each other.<br> We both have an
			active lifestyle that includes biking, travel, our dogs, our friends,
			and our own personal journeys.<br> Yes Chef came from the
			necessity of me not wanting to go through the effort of finding meals
			and building shopping lists.<br> Mainly the shopping list part.
			For some reason I just really don't enjoy making the list.<br>
			This is where Yes Chef plays a role.
		<p>
		<h4>What does Yes Chef Do?</h4>
		<p>
			Yes Chef provides meals for you to browse.<br> If you don't feel
			like browsing, find a recipe at Random.<br> Once you've found
			something you like. Add it to the Meal Plan.<br> Once you've
			made a plan you can then add everything to the grocery cart.<br>
			(Eventually YC will do the shopping for you!)
